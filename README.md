Link to github repo: https://github.com/spencerjpross/ross-spencer-module-1-challenge

Link to my wireframe that I used to create the outline of the website: https://excalidraw.com/#json=UjSRN187a0LKsnu15fVhl,kPd-RbO2CfTYUc0PWrSQMw

This project is to show I understand how to create an outline HTML file and make it dynamic with CSS.  

I created a portfolio website that is responsive to the viewers viewport and has links to my github, social media and previous projects.
